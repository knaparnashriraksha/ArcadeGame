# Arcade Game

- Visual assets and a game loop engine are provided; using these tools one must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.
- This Classic Arcade Game has been developed using Object-Oriented JavaScript, HTML and CSS

## How to play the game

1. The main idea of the game is to reach the water on the other side, without colliding with any enemy
2. On the way, if there is any collision between the player and the enemy, the game is reset.
3. If the player reaches the water successfully, he can either decide to continue playing the game, or quit.
4. If the player decides to continue the game, his score and the level keep updating each time he successfully reaches the water.
5. If the player decides to quit the game, his final score and the recent level is displayed to him along with a thank you message.

## How to run

1. Extract the zipped contents
2. Open the index.html in your browser to start playing.

## Why This Project?
- Games have a lot of objects and those objects do a lot of different things; but sometimes they do some very similar things as well.
- This creates a great opportunity to practice object-oriented programming, an important programming paradigm that influences your application architecture and provides performance optimization.

## What did I learn?
- I learned JavaScript’s object oriented programming features to write eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects.
- I discovered a variety of ways inheritance and delegation can be used to create well architected and performant applications.

## How does it help my career?
- Developing using JavaScript enables the development of complex applications on the web.
- JavaScript runs on normal web browsers, which makes it one of the most accessible and flexible programming languages.
- Complex applications that must be “broken down” into simpler entities that manage their own properties and functionality
